# ABS_Assessment
This was another project as part of the Dev10 training program, centered around data visualization using US Census data.

The Group_Assessment file includes the code used to create the data visualizations along with the initial ETL code, while the ABS_ETL file is the cleaned ETL that is featured in the group ETL report.
